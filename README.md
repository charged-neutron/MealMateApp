# 🍽️ MealMate — Connecting Messes with NGOs to Fight Hunger

**MealMate** is an Android application built using **Kotlin** and **XML** that connects **mess administrators** with **NGO representatives**.  
Its purpose is to ensure that **leftover food from messes** is **donated efficiently** to NGOs, so that it can reach **people in need** instead of going to waste.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Mess Admin**
   - Registers or logs in using Firebase Authentication.  
   - Posts details about leftover food (item name, quantity, description, time, etc.).  

2. **NGO Admin**
   - Logs in to browse available food posts.  
   - Accepts food donations and coordinates offline collection.  

3. **Firebase Backend**
   - Handles authentication and stores user and food data in Realtime Database.  
   - Keeps both parties’ data synchronized in real-time.
